* Specific goals, activities, outcomes may include:
  * Assessing current documentation (Github and JIRAConfluence) for gaps and weaknesses.
    * How can we assess current documentation alongside the Islandora community, and make it simple for people to comment and contribute to documentation?
  * Advising on / enriching the documentation platforms for Islandora software
    * Developing new documentation in the current platforms.
    * Advising on the future of the documentation (where it would live, and how it will be updated)
    * Working to lower barriers to entry for creating good in-code documentation
    * Develop templates and best-practice guidelines for Islandora readme files and promote the addition of these to the software acceptance process (as a mandatory part of the acceptance process)  
  * Ensuring a sustained effort towards documentation
    * Provide a workflow for adding new documentation with releases 
    * Work closely with the release management team to prepare documentation for new releases
    * Find out how to get contributions from developers and add them to the current documentation
* The interest group will meet once a month virtually (eg. via Skype). A call for agenda items will be posted to the Islandora Google Group 1 week prior to the meeting. The convenor will appoint a note taker for the meeting and meeting notes will be made available at some url.
